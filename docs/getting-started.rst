.. _getting-started:

Initial setup
=============

.. note::

    `lcdb-wf` is tested and heavily used on Linux.

    It is likely to work on macOS as long as all relevant conda packages are
    available for macOS -- though this is not tested.

    It will **not** work on Windows due to a general lack of support of Windows
    in bioinformatics tools.

Setup required once per system
------------------------------
We use `bioconda <https://bioconda.github.io>`_ to automatically install
software into the working directory without needing admin rights on the
machine.

If you have the Anaconda Python distribution, you already have conda.
Otherwise, install `Miniconda <https://conda.io/miniconda.html>`_.

**Optional:** 
- Run the following commands to set up your conda channels. This puts the
  `lcdb` channel as lowest priority (this channel has the `lcdblib` package),
  and then matches the channel order required by `bioconda`.

.. code-block:: bash

   conda config --add channels defaults
   conda config --add channels bioconda
   conda config --add channels conda-forge


Setup required once per project
-------------------------------

The following should be done each time you set up a project.

1. Clone the git repo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Clone the repository from github into a new directory of your choosing and
change to that directory.

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/lcdb/lcdb-wf.git my-project-dir
    cd my-project-dir


.. _create-env:

2. Create a new conda environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following command will create a top-level environment with Snakemake and
other requirements. It needs to be `activated` any time you'll be working with
these workflows.

If you're not familiar with ``conda``, it installs particular versions of
software in an isolated location on your computer. When you "activate" the
environment, it places that location at the beginning of your ``$PATH``
variable, so that any executables there are found first. It does not affect any
existing installation of any software on your machine and does not need root
privileges.

**It is recommended that you create a separate environment directory for each 
project and include it with the project**.
That way you can update packages in each project independently of
any others, and yet the environment will always be close at hand. This is 
especially good practice in shared space as others can easily find and activate 
the environment specific to the project.
Here we use the name "env" for the new environment to clearly denote its contents, 
but you can use anything. Note that here we specify the channels to use, which 
include ``bioconda`` which depends on ``conda-forge``, and ``lcdb`` which provides 
the ``lcdblib`` package used by these workflows.

::

    conda create -p ./env --file requirements.txt

Then activate the environment::

    source activate lcdb-wf

Eventually when you're done, you can "deactivate", which removes the
environment location from your ``$PATH`` until the next time you activate it.
You might want to hold off on this for now if you'll be running the tests::

    source deactivate

.. note::

   An alternative approach is to create an environment at a specific path, for
   example inside a project directory:

   .. code-block:: bash

       conda create -p ./env --file requirements.txt
       source activate ./env

Next steps
----------

You may want to run tests to make sure everything is set up (see
:ref:`running-the-tests`), or jump right in to learning about how to configure
the workflows for your particular experiment (see :ref:`config`).
